# Peptides_Analysis

Code for paper 'Evidence supporting an antimicrobial origin of targeting peptides to endosymbiotic organelles', Clotilde Garrido, Oliver D Caspari, Yves Choquet, Francis-AndrÃ© Wollman, Ingrid Lafontaine

Analysing short peptides using z-scale factor (Hellberg 1987) that represent the physicochimical properties. 
Process auto-cross covariance, dimensional reduction and classification for vizulising and compare differents groups of peptides.
